# DATABASE:
# A dictionary containing the settings for all databases to be used with Django.
# The DATABASES setting must configure a default database; you can define as many additional databases as needed.
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/settings/#databases
# This database configuration uses an environment variable in URL form named DJANGO_DATABASE_URL.
# Examples of such configuration URLs are:
# - POSTGRESQL: postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME (with psycopg driver)
# - MYSQL: mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME (with mysqlclient driver)
# - SQLITE: sqlite:///FILE_NAME (driver included by default in Python)

# SECURITY
# The SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER variable is used in Django to indicate that the application is behind a reverse proxy
# (such as Nginx or a load balancer) that handles the SSL protocol.
# By setting SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ("HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO", "https"), we specify that Django should treat requests
# with the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO header as secure if they are marked with the value "https".
# This allows Django to properly handle these requests as being made over HTTPS, even if the connection between
# Django and the proxy is over HTTP.
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/settings/#secure-proxy-ssl-header
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ("HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO", "https")

SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = env.bool("DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT", default=True)  # type: ignore

# The SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True variable ensures that session cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections,
# enhancing security by preventing their transmission over unsecured connections.
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/settings/#session-cookie-secure
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True

# The SESSION_COOKIE_NAME = "__Secure-sessionid" variable allows for setting a custom name for the session cookie,
# and the __Secure- prefix is often used to indicate that this cookie should only be sent over HTTPS connections.
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/settings/#session-cookie-name
SESSION_COOKIE_NAME = "__Secure-sessionid"

# The CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True variable ensures that the CSRF cookie (used for protection against CSRF attacks)
# is only transmitted over HTTPS connections, enhancing security against attacks on unsecured connections.
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/settings/#csrf-cookie-secure
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True

# The CSRF_COOKIE_NAME = "__Secure-csrftoken" variable customizes the name of the CSRF cookie,

# The SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 60 variable activates the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy for 60 seconds,

# The SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS variable indicates whether the HSTS policy (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
# should also apply to all subdomains of the site. Setting this via an environment variable, defaulting to True here,
# ensures that all requests to subdomains are also forced to use HTTPS, enhancing security across the entire domain.

# This means that browsers supporting this feature will refuse any HTTP connection right from the first visit,
# enhancing security by avoiding attacks before even the first unsecured HTTP request.
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/settings/#secure-hsts-preload
SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = env.bool("DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD", default=True)  # type: ignore

# The SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF variable, enabled here by default through an environment variable,
# adds the HTTP X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header to responses.
# This header prevents browsers from guessing the content type and handling it differently from what is specified,
# which enhances security by preventing certain attacks, such as those related to misinterpreted file types (MIME type sniffing).

# ADMIN
